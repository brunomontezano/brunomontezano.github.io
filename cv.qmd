## Courses 

* [Introduction to R Course (in Portuguese)](https://brunomontezano.github.io/r-workshop/). Online. April, 2023.
  - I conducted a comprehensive Introduction to R course for researchers in the healthcare field, consisting of seven lectures under the umbrella of the [AlliaNCE (Artificial Intelligence in Neuroscience) research group](https://allianceresearchgroup.com/) at UFRGS. The course covered essential concepts related to data manipulation and analysis using the open-source programming language R. The curriculum included lectures, practical exercises, and weekly labs for hands-on application of learned concepts. The course website provided additional resources, such as recommended materials, FAQs, lecture slides, codes, and class recordings. Homework assignments with corresponding answer keys were available, and a tips section featured short videos illustrating data manipulation and analysis routines. The seven classes spanned topics from R introduction to machine learning applications, equipping participants with valuable skills for data-driven research in healthcare. 

## Lectures
