I am a psychologist and data analyst who specializes in using machine learning
techniques to tackle mental health problems. My research focuses mainly on mood
disorders, with a particular interest in bipolar disorder. Over the years, I
have published papers on a variety of topics related to mental health.

Through my work, I strive to uncover new insights into the causes and treatment
of mood disorders, and to develop data-driven approaches that can help improve
the lives of people living with these conditions. Whether it's using machine
learning algorithms to analyze complex datasets or collaborating with other
researchers to design new studies, I am passionate about finding new ways to
apply my expertise in psychology and data analysis to make a real difference in
the field of mental health and precision psychiatry.
