April, 2023.\n\nI conducted a comprehensive Introduction to R course for researchers in the healthcare field, consisting of seven lectures under the umbrella of the AlliaNCE (Artificial Intelligence in Neuroscience) research group at UFRGS. The course covered essential concepts related to data manipulation and analysis using the open-source programming language R. The curriculum included lectures, practical exercises, and weekly labs for hands-on application of learned concepts. The course website provided additional resources, such as recommended materials, FAQs, lecture slides, codes, and class recordings. Homework assignments with corresponding answer keys were available, and a tips section featured short videos illustrating data manipulation and analysis routines. The seven classes spanned topics from R introduction to machine learning applications, equipping participants with valuable skills for data-driven research in healthcare."
